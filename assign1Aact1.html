    <p><img src="C:\Users\bhagw\OneDrive\Pictures\SHATANU blazer photo-fotor-bg-remover-20240515191528.png" alt="Your Image"> I am a web
        developer with a keen interest in creating dynamic and
        responsive web applications. I enjoy working with HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript to build engaging user experiences.
        <strong>Learning</strong> new technologies
        and applying them creatively is my passion.
    <p>Outside of work, I am deeply interested in
        <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and its
        applications in solving real-world problems. I believe in
        continuous learning and improving every day. My goal is to
        use technology to make a <em>positive impact</em> on
        society.
        </p>
    <p>I also love teaching and sharing knowledge
        with others. Over the years, I have conducted several
        workshops on web development. My mission is to help others
        grow and achieve their dreams.
        <span class="highlight">Empathy</span> and
        <strong>collaboration</strong> are values that I live by.</p>
